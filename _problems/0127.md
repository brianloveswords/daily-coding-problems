# Problem 127

Let's represent an integer in a linked list format by having each node represent a digit in the number. The nodes make up the number in reversed order.

For example, `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` is the number `54321`.

Given two linked lists in this format, return their sum in the same linked list format.

## Examples

Given

```text
9 -> 9

5 -> 2
```

return 124 (99 + 25) as:

```text
4 -> 2 -> 1
```
