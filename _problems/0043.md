# Problem 43

Implement a stack that has the following methods:

- `push(val)`: push an element onto the stack
- `pop()`: pop off and return the topmost element of the stack.
  - If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return `null`.
- `max()`, which returns the maximum value in the stack currently.
  - If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return `null`.

Each method should run in constant time.
