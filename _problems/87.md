# Problem 87

A rule looks like this:

```text
A NE B
```

This means this means point A is located northeast of point B.

```text
A SW C
```

means that point A is southwest of C.

Given a list of rules, check if the sum of the rules validate.

## Example

```text
A N B
B NE C
C N A
```

does not validate, since A cannot be both north and south of C.

```text
A NW B
A N B
```

is considered valid.
