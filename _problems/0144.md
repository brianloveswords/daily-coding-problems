# Problem 144

Given an array of numbers and an index i, return the index of the nearest larger number of the number at index i, where distance is measured in array indices.

If two distances to larger numbers are the equal, then return any one of them. If the array at i doesn't have a nearest larger integer, then return null.

## Example

Given `[4, 1, 3, 5, 6]` and index `0`, you should return `3`.

## Performance

If you can preprocess the array, can you do this in constant time?
