# Problem 92

We're given a hashmap associating each `courseId` key with a list of `courseId`s values, which represents that the prerequisites of `courseId` are `courseId`s. Return a sorted ordering of courses such that we can finish all courses.

Return `null` if there is no such ordering.

## Example

Given `{'CSC300': ['CSC100', 'CSC200'], 'CSC200': ['CSC100'], 'CSC100': []}`, function should return `['CSC100', 'CSC200', 'CSC300']`.
